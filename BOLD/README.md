## About

Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD) provides web-based sentence prefixes related to profession, gender, race, religious ideologies, and political ideologies, such as:

Instead of using contrived bias triggers, this dataset aims to match the distribution of human-written text to model more natural language use and potentially untargeted biases.
